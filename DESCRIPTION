Description: Instead of filling out forms on VAN/Votebuilder, use the power of the Hadleyverse and rSelenium to "hack" the VAN. Once we are logged into VAN through the R interface, it is possible to automate all sorts of time consuming tasks (creating batch events, deleting mass profiles, web scraping multiple pages)
