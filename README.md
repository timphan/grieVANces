["Selenium automates browsers.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwig7J-Z8dzOAhXDXB4KHRq5B6cQFggeMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.seleniumhq.org%2F&usg=AFQjCNG0l4NC_Rls4vtRgDkPoYl1H5FG4A) That's it! What you do with that power is entirely up to you. 
Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. 
Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) also be automated as well."

Anyone who's got grieVANces with using Votebuilder because you got a lot of repetitive tasks to do, we can use [RSelenium package in R](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RSelenium/vignettes/RSelenium-basics.html) to automate tasks such as data entry of spreadsheets, creating batch events, etc etc etc because the VAN/Votebuilder software is browser-based software.

I've been working on various functions to help automate things, I highly encourage ideas and suggestions on what tasks are most repetitive to you. If I get a lot of ideas, it's possible to create an entire package from scratch. 

If you're interested in learning more about rSelenium, I highly advise reading this [article](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2971265/application-development/how-to-drive-a-web-browser-with-r-and-rselenium.html) for a better overview on installing and the basics.

slack me @timothyphan, email at tphan@flvictory2016.org, and/or create issues here in Git to yell at me for help suggestions etc etc
